### There are several errors in the data.sh file.

1. One member from the group should fork this repo. **You will be the Team Lead.**
2. The other members should fork the Team Lead's repo
3. Work together to do the following:
    - Fix the errors
    - Run and test the script
    - Commit your changes to your branch
4. One member, other than the Team Lead, should create a new pull request.
6. The Team Lead should do the following:
    - Review the pull request
    - If everything looks okay, then merge the changes.


### If you finish this, then work on the next part.

1. Connect your github account to your VM or your Pi if you have it setup.
2. Use vim to make changes to the data files.
    - Add a separate git feature description to each data file.
    - Create a pull request for the changes.
